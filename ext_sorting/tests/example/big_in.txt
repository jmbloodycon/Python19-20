Since Midnight Louie’s mystery 
adventures began in 1992
the series is a retro-modern 
saga that portrays twenty-five
years of amazing 
Las Vegas Strip reinvention 
from then to today. 
Yet the story only 
covers a couple of years 
in the lives of the four 
human characters: 
two women, two men; 
two pro and two amateur detectives. 
It’s like the old movies that filmed 
a foreground couple walking on a 
treadmill against a constantly 
changing background.
You will watch the Las Vegas Strip, 
technology and detection methods evolve as
the characters veer from allies 
to antagonists to…romantic quadrangle anyone? 
And even the irreverent rascal, Midnight Louie, 
will become politically correct in 
one key department.
We’ve loved and kept your 
cards and letters and now emails
and appreciate the thousands of 
stamps you’ve sent to help snail-mail 
the annual newsletter, 
and those of you who’ve bought 
the books and T-shirts. 
We’re amazed you always say you 
know how busy we are. 
How do you know? 
We try not to whine,
because we are so privileged
to be doing what we’re doing. 
Yes, a writing career is 12/7. 
I’m often surprised 
it’s a national holiday. 
I’m always wishing 
I could answer you more, 
but deadlines never die! 
Those of you I’ve been 
in contact with have been 
delightful and so inspiring 
and understanding.
Deservedly nicknamed 
“Kitty the Cutter” 
by my Miss Temple, 
she is the local lass 
that Max and his cousin 
Sean boyishly competed 
for in long-ago Northern Ireland, 
who turned embittered stalker. 
Finding Mr. Max as impossible 
to trace as Lieutenant Molina has, 
Kitty the C settled for harassing 
with tooth and claw the nearest 
innocent bystander, primarily 
Mr. Matt Devine.
Miss Kathleen 
O’Connor’s popping 
up again like Jill 
the Ripper has been 
raising hell for we 
who reside at a vintage 
round apartment building 
called the Circle Ritz, 
owned by seventy-something 
free spirit, 
Miss Electra Lark.
Now reunited with 
her long-ago IRA associates, 
Miss Kathleen knows 
a life is at stake unless 
the man she has tormented 
for the past two years 
betrays an associate 
of his she stalked.
Someone (Miss Kathleen?) 
arranged for Mr. Max 
Kinsella to hit the 
wall of the Neon 
Nightmare club 
with lethal 
impact while undercover. 
His enduring traumatic 
memory loss means 
he knows he and 
my roommate 
were once a committed 
couple, 
but he 
recalls 
none of 
the emotional 
and, ahem, 
spicy details. 
So far. 
And now he 
returns as 
a secret agent again.
All this human 
conniving and 
canoodling 
and sex and 
violence makes 
me glad that 
I have a simpler 
social life, 
such as just 
trying to 
get along 
with my 
unacknowledged daughter…
MISS 
MIDNIGHT 
LOUISE
This streetwise 
minx insinuated 
herself into 
my cases until 
I was forced 
to set up shop 
with her as 
Midnight Investigations, 
Inc. 
She alleges 
that I am her 
deadbeat dad, 
but I will 
never cop 
to that charge.
MA BARKER
My long-lost 
mama who 
gave me a last 
tummy-lick 
and prodded 
my rear out 
of our humble 
abode next to 
the Bellagio 
Dumpsters. 
Even high-end 
hotels need 
down-to-earth 
garbage control.
I elected to 
continue on my 
own, 
though 
Ma now r
uns the to
ughest feline 
street gang in 
Vegas. 
She is not pretty, 
but she is pretty 
effective. 
I have never 
quite banished 
a quiver at the 
memory of a 
four shiv-tip 
disciplinary 
slap-down from 
Mommy Dearest.
So that is 
how things 
stand today, 
even more full 
of danger, 
angst, 
and criminal 
pursuits. 
However, 
things are 
seldom 
what 
they seem, 
and almost 
never that 
way in Las Vegas. 
So any surprising 
developments 
do not 
surprise me. 
Everything 
in Sin City 
is always 
up for 
grabs 24/7—guilt, 
innocence, 
money, 
power, 
love, 
loss, 
death, 
and significant 
others.
I comfort 
myself that 
my ordeals 
may soon 
end and 
I can pull 
the covers 
up over my 
thick blanket 
of pages 
and catch 
some beauty 
sleep for a
decade or two. 
But wait…
Like Las Vegas, 
the City 
That Never Sleeps, 
Midnight Louie, 
private eye, 
also has a 
sobriquet: 
the Kitty 
That Never Sleeps.
With this crew, 
who could?
Writing a 
series as 
long 
as this, 
over 25 years, 
means we’ve 
written more 
than three 
million words 
in this 
series alone. 
We started 
out sure 
we’d remember 
everything that 
had been done, 
and somewhere 
along the 
way realized 
we were not 
human computers. 
Books are proofread 
and edited 
many times, 
but errors 
still slip through 
because most 
of us read 
what we expect 
to see. S
ome imperfections 
can’t be 
fixed right now, 
because control 
of the books 
are in other hands. 
There are dozens 
of people (and cats) 
to thank, but 
two brave 
readers have 
volunteered 
to read the 
entire series 
over for 
errors and typos, 
and they deserve 
our heartfelt 
thanks for 
helping make 
us as perfect 
as we can 
be for 
ourselves 
and our readers.

IRA associates, 
Miss Kathleen knows

for the 
past two years 
betrays an associate 
of his 
she stalked.
Someone (Miss Kathleen?) 
arranged 
for Mr. Max 
Kinsella to hit the
She was on her feet 
by the bed, 
hands to ears, 
watching her 
peaceful arched 
white ceiling 
become 
rinsed by 
lurid forms 
of red 
and blue 
as if as awash 
in patriotic 
stingrays.
The red LED 
lights 
on her 
bedside clock 
read 1:09 a.m. 
Matt wouldn’t 
be off the 
air until 2 a.m. 
She was on her own. 
At least no 
intruder 
had broken 
into her unit, 
not the 
case ten 
days ago.
Her sleep 
T-shirt was 
short, her 
feet were 
bare and 
she needed 
to get 
outside to 
see what 
was happening.
Even as another 
siren came 
bowling toward 
the usually 
grave-silent 
Circle Ritz 
apartment and 
condominium building, 
she saw 
Midnight 
Louie’s black 
silhouette 
stretching up 
to reach 
and pull down 
the French doors’ 
levered 
handles to the 
small balcony 
outside.
So that’s 
how you make 
your escape, 
she muttered, 
burrowing into the 
winter 
side of 
her closet 
for a velvety 
micro-fleece 
jogging suit 
she slept in 
on cold desert 
nights. 
She’d have 
awakened an 
icicle wearing 
them in her 
native Minnesota, 
but in a 
Las Vegas July 
they were more 
of a sweat suit.
Temple didn’t own 
a flip-flop—cursed 
backdrop for hammertoes 
and other unlovely 
foot maladies—but 
she did have 
a pair of fuzzy 
skunk slippers, 
child size. 
She stuffed her 
size-five 
feet in them 
and opened 
a door to 
follow the 
big black cat, 
now balancing 
on the railing, 
out into warm, 
noisy night. 
Below, other 
owners and 
tenants were 
milling, 
half dressed, 
around the slice 
of parking 
lot and 
pool visible 
from her 
second-floor perch.
She craned her neck 
to the balcony above, 
Matt’s place, 
but it wasn’t an 
object of police 
interest either.
Time to go down 
and see what 
the neighbors knew. 
Louie had 
opted to go up, 
his sharp 
nails snagging 
the bark of the 
single venerable 
palm tree 
that overarched 
the 
five-story building.
Skunk slippers 
don’t climb well, 
so Temple grabbed 
her cell phone 
and unit key and 
headed for 
the seventy-year-old 
elevator. 
Since the 
fifties-era 
Circle Ritz was 
actually round, 
she had to 
trot halfway 
around the central 
mechanical core 
to wait 
for the car.
The small lobby 
was abuzz with 
people as hastily 
(if not as absurdly) 
attired as she. 
Outside, more of 
the same awaited her.
Some words from 
the murmuring 
neighbors hung 
like audible 
billboards far 
above the rest. 
Burglar… 
Shot… 
Three squad cars… 
Ambulance… 
Taken away.
Obviously 
the stir 
centered 
around the 
farther part 
of the building, 
which overlooked 
the pool house 
pavilion. 
Temple edged 
through the neighbors, 
nodding at 
some she knew. 
Then she 
heard 
someone 
behind her say, 
No, not Max Kinsella. 
He moved out a 
couple years 
ago, but, 
yeah, 
he used 
to be a 
famous magician…
This bit 
of discussion 
coincided 
with her 
sighting a tall, 
dark man 
talking with 
a police officer 
who was 
shaking his 
head “No”, 
even as he took notes.
Yes, it 
was “No”. 
Mr. Tall, 
Dark and 
Confident 
was not 
Temple’s 
former 
significant other. 
The Milan-styled 
beige summer 
suit he wore, 
now also 
wearing the 
strafes 
of red and blue 
lights 
that bathed 
everybody 
out here, 
was one 
of an uncommon 
but plural 
Vegas Genus 
of Gentleman Gangster, a 
Fontana brother.
How somebody as 
squat and 
chubby as 
Macho Maria 
Fontana 
had ten 
nephews as 
sleek and 
politely 
formidable 
as the 
Berettas 
they carried 
under their 
thirteen-hundred-dollar 
suit coats, 
Temple would never 
know. 
And only 
two of 
them married yet, 
the youngest 
and the eldest.
From the faint, 
first siren 
call of the 
police cruisers, 
I knew that my 
role was not 
to remain on 
the ground among 
the powerless gawkers. 
I eyed the limp 
victim being 
lifted onto a 
gurney for a 
rough ride in 
an ambulance 
that may finish 
him off for 
good and immediately 
hit the Palm 
Tree Trail up 
to the penthouse 
balcony from 
whence he had come.
I regret to say my 
Miss Temple 
is as bloodthirsty 
as any one of 
these eight-to-eighty-year-old 
onlookers treated 
to a crime scene 
in their midst. B
esides, she 
has the able 
support of a 
Fontana brother 
who is far 
too fastidious 
to allow any
random blood 
drop to decorate 
his lapel. 
He will restrain 
her from giving 
too many pieces 
of her mind to 
the local police, 
given her worry 
about Miss Electra 
Lark’s brush 
with a 
soon-to-be-dead guy.
I am not a sentimentalist, 
though, 
and wonder 
if our free-spirited 
landlady has 
flipped her lid. 
Not that 
she wears hats. 
She prefers 
to use her 
snow-white 
hair as a 
canvas for 
bright temporary 
colors. 
I fear that 
I have seen 
a few white 
Persian cats 
and poodle 
dogs so styled, 
and it is 
the height 
of silliness, 
but at least 
Miss Electra has 
free will in the matter.
Now she has no freedom 
at all. 
I did not 
exert all 
my efforts 
to save her 
so recently 
to give up now. 
Even if I must 
encounter 
her “psychic” 
Birman cat, 
Karma, 
here in the 
penthouse. 
Karma is by 
nature reclusive 
and I 
expect she is 
hiding by 
the back wall 
under the couch 
after 
the hullabaloo 
of a burglar 
turned falling missive.
